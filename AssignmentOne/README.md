## Assignment One
For this assignment, I decided to go with a dark and minimal theme. Something that's easy on the eyes.
I made the webpage responsive on all devices to follow best practices. For JavaScript, I decided to make two JS
files in order to separate logic and not just have one very large JS file. In the `app.js` file I import the 
restaurant objects defined in `client.js`. Each function in `app.js` has **JSDOC**  documentation. The functions are organized
from `main functions` to `helper functions` in order to allow easy traversal through the file.
